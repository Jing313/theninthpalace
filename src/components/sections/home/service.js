									The Inception Collection's mint is followed by the launch of The Resistance Economy and Auxiliary Airdrop. The PC and Mobile games will both be launched alongside our ConnectONE backend, meant to provide frictionless onboarding for non-crypto gamers, shortly after the Aux AD. Throughout this time we will be hiring enthusiastically, scaling our servers and backend systems to manage MMO functionality, and developing the Asset Marketplace. The "Moonshot" Goal for the project is to become an incubator for other Web3 games with ambitious goals.

									Quality and sustainability are the ideals driving the project. The NFTs are hand-drawn with unimaginable detail; certain NFTs hold hidden messages. The minting process is unique and fair. We believe itâ€™s the future of minting. The game mechanics and progressions are not only designed to drive excellent gameplay but are unique to specific metadata. The game economy was constructed to be sustainable but exciting, complex, and most importantly scalable. The narrative of The Ninth Palace guides the PC game; the mobile game's narrative is a sub-set of The Ninth Palace storyline but a bit more romantic.

									The future of the project is full of work. This is a young company. We're free spirits with a dream and an idea of what we want to play. Our roadmap encompasses the next 18 months and the v2 roadmap is already being plotted for time. We intend to build a franchise from The Ninth Palace. We want to sponsor gamers, hold events, and finance Web3 game builds for talented developers and build teams. We want to grow our core team, our industry network, and our community. Most importantly we want to be the bridge into Web3 for non-crypto gamers.

									We're a business. We started this project by tracking expenses, investments, and work hours. Our accounting principles actually work with Web3. We've applied for legal registration in Singapore, and are awaiting approval for a corporate-crypto bank account. We've worked with legal advisors from the beginning to ensure the game economy would be compliant across jurisdictions and any future TGE would satisfy Howey Test requirements. Our secret to sustainability actually lies in our approach to running a start-up company. Being capital-efficient enables us to plan for 30 months of runway. This is the future of Web3 gaming.
